    /// 1. **Trailing empty cells are stripped** from every row, the header
    ///    included (the caller shapes before gating). Spreadsheet apps
    ///    emit `...,Notes,,,` whenever the sheet's used range outgrew the
    ///    data, and the rigid header gate must not reject a re-saved file
    ///    for it (amended criterion 3). Only *empty* cells strip —
    ///    whitespace-only cells survive to the field policy, whose
    ///    trimming rules own that question.
    /// 2. **Wholly blank rows drop silently** — after stripping, a blank
    ///    line (one empty cell) or an all-commas line (several) has no
    ///    cells left, and reporting it would put a phantom "no name" skip
    ///    on an otherwise clean file. Dropped rows keep their absence
    ///    invisible; surviving rows keep the spreadsheet numbers the
    ///    parser gave them, so a skip reported after a blank line still
    ///    points where Numbers points.
    ///
    /// A row that legitimately *ends* in empty optional columns (an empty
    /// Notes cell) loses them here too; the field policy pads under-length
    /// rows back and treats the padded cells as blank — strip-then-pad is
    /// identity for legitimate trailing blanks.
